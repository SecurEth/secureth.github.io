SecurEth is an organization that manages design guidelines for smart contract engineers.

Our guidelines create a common framework for risk assessment and mitigation
that has a strong connection to the state of the art by accepting community suggestions
with expert review by sponsored representatives from experienced industry players.

SecurEth is first and foremost a community resource.

Everyone has a voice, and the purpose of our expert review board is to identify
technical issues with proposals and ensure the resulting content retains consistent voice
and clarity of thought when it is published.

Our experts and the overhead funding of the organization are sponsored by the
industry directly, ensuring that our products are closely tied to the needs of the industry
and that our interests align with that of the overall Ethereum community.
