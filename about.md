SecurEth is an organization that develops design guidelines for smart contract engineers.
The basis for this work is to help create a common framework for risk assessment and mitigation
that has a strong connection to the state of the art by accepting community suggestions
with expert review by our industry partners.

SecurEth will always remain a public resource. Everyone has a voice, and the purpose of our
expert review board is to identify technical issues with proposals and ensure the resulting
content retains consistent voice and clarity of thought. These experts are sponsored by our
industry partners, along with the overhead funding of the organization, ensuring that our
interests remains bound with that of the industry, and the overall Ethereum community as well.
