# SecurEth
*Smart Contract Development Guidelines for Ethereum*

---

## About

SecurEth is an organization that develops development guidelines for smart contract engineers.
The basis for this work is to help create a common framework for risk assessment and mitigation
that has a strong connection to the state of the art by accepting community suggestions
with expert review by our industry partners.

SecurEth will always remain a public resource. Everyone has a voice, and the purpose of our
expert review board is to identify technical issues with proposals and ensure the resulting
content retains consistent voice and clarity of thought. These experts are sponsored by our
industry partners, along with the overhead funding of the organization, ensuring that our
interests remains bound with that of the industry, and the overall Ethereum community as well.

## The SecurEth Stamp
The SecurEth Stamp is a smart contract that provides ERC 721 compatible tokenized "Stamps" that
can be applied to smart contracts deployed on the public mainnet.
These stamps are applied by Security Auditing firms on behalf of their clients as a public record
that auditing was performed conforming to the guidelines.

**A Stamp is irrefutible once issued.**
This means that a stamp is part of the public record, and is a central location to point to
for what documentation and auditing were performed on a specific contract.
When an event occurs, this stamp is investigated and the auditing firm is brought in to an
investigation with the client in order to determine the nature of the accident.

This investigation never places blame, but instead handles, in a structured way, where the
process is deficient and identifies oppurtunities for improvement.
This investigation process informs the wider community and makes our software products stronger
as a result, sending a signal to the wider user community that we develop software to the highest
quality possible.
