**Smart Contract Systems form the basis of your business-critical logic and data.**

They handle valuable assets on behalf of you and your customers,
and allow you to operate effectively in an increasingly global world.

The Ethereum Network opens your business platform to an open and permissionless market,
but it also opens your software to one of the most caustic environments that has ever been created.

Smart Contract Systems for global trade on the Ethereum Network must be developed to the
highest quality to make sure your business can survive this environment.

Our mission at SecurEth is to guide software developers in the Ethereum Community towards
building Smart Contract Systems that adhere to the highest quality in design and verification,
to ensure that we solve problems **before** they happen so we can build in world-class security
*as a feature*.
